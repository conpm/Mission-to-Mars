# Mission-to-Mars
---
The purpose of this repository was to create a webapp using flask which could display data which has been scraped from various websites.  In order to do this, an app.py file was created which used formatting from an index.html file to format a web page.  On the webpage there is a button, which when pushed, performs the webscraping and updates the various parts of the page.
